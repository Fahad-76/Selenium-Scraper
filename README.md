# Selenium-Scraper
Web scraper built with Selenium in Python to extract match statistics and match recap from the official Premier League Website

This Webscraper is able to handle the dynamic JavaScript content to extract necessary data and arrange it into a Pandas Dataframe for ease of analysis and export

Clicks on the Stats tab and scrapes all the relevant statistics

Make use of a custom parser with known stats to be able to arrange the data into a pandas dataframe since not all the stats follow the same structure.

Main Libraries are:
-Selenium
-Pandas

Getting Started:
-Clone this Repository
-Install key libraries
-Run the Script

Example output can be seen below:
